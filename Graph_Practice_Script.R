## The goal of this code is to plot a function and the derivative of that function. Comments with a single "#" are lines of code that should be run in the console before executing the main script.
## The function shall be f(x) = (x^2 + 2x - 4.5) + 17
# library(tidyverse)

#usethis::use_git()
#usethis::use_github()

fx <- expression((x^2 + 2x -4.5)+17)
